    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Resolving the conflicts in <code>composer.json</code> can be done in the usual way: use a <code>diff</code> tool and pull into the
merged file the correct changes from both sides. Save the merged file, add it to the index and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>

<p>Regarding a VCS conflict, <code>composer.lock</code> behaves more like a binary file. <!-- more -->
It is possible to do a manual merge but in the end the generated file will be invalid because it also contains
a checksum that won&rsquo;t match any more after this operation.
The checksum can be fixed afterwards by running <code>composer update --lock</code> but, as a side-effect,
this command also computes the current set of dependencies and renders all the manual hardwork useless.</p>

<p>The easiest (and the correct) way to resolve <code>composer.lock</code> merge conflicts is to pick one of the versions
(<code>yours</code> should be the one because it matches the current content of the <code>vendor</code> directory)
then run <code>composer update --root-reqs</code> to update <code>composer.lock</code> with the packages that were added or
modified in <code>composer.json</code> on the other branch.</p>

<p>The commands are:</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset HEAD -- composer.lock
$ git checkout -- composer.lock
$ composer update --root-reqs
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>composer.lock</code> contains the changes introduced by the merged branch and it can be added to the index to
conclude the merge.</p>

    <link href="https://axiac.ro/blog/dont-forget-to-clone-the-datetime-objects/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-17T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>https://axiac.ro/blog/dont-forget-to-clone-the-datetime-objects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php"><code>DateTime</code></a> class and its friends introduced in PHP 5.2 are a very nice replacement
for the old date &amp; time processing functions (<code>date()</code>, <code>getdate()</code>, <code>strftime()</code>, <code>strtotime()</code> and so on).</p>

<p>But they come with a minor glitch that is hidden in the plain sight: they are objects and as all the other
objects in PHP, they are assigned and passed as parameters by reference<a href="#note-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and not as copies.</p>

<p>Most of the time I think of a DateTime as a <code>Value Object</code>, passing it from here to there
without special precautions. And most of the times this works just fine as long as the code doesn&rsquo;t
try to change it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When it starts wreaking havoc I remember that <code>DateTime</code> is a class, the instances of it are objects
and are passed by reference<a href="#note-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> both as method arguments and as their
return values. And special precautions needs to be taken when a method starts modifying
a <code>DateTime</code> instance that was not created by the same object (because the one that created it
might still hold a reference to it).</p>

<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> always clone the <code>DateTime</code> objects that were not created by the current function
when you intend to change them.</p>

<h4>Later edit (August 2017)</h4>

<p>Since PHP 5.5 it&rsquo;s better to use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetimeimmutable.php"><code>DateTimeImmutable</code></a> objects whenever it&rsquo;s possible.
They cannot be modified after they are created (they behave like true Value Objects). The methods declared
in <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetimeinterface.php"><code>DateTimeInterface</code></a> that modify the <code>DateTime</code> objects automatically create
and return clones for <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetimeimmutable.php"><code>DateTimeImmutable</code></a> objects.</p>

<p>PHP 5.5 was 20 months old at the time when I wrote this post, but I was still working with PHP 5.3
and PHP 5.4 because of the business constraints.</p>

<hr />

<p><a name="note-1"></a>
<sup>[1]</sup> <em>The <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.references.php">PHP documentation</a> explains that they are not really references but
different variables storing the same object identifier (which involves an additional redirection layer).
This makes them work more like pointers but this is just an implementation detail.
From the outside they look like they are passed by reference.</em></p>

    <updated>2014-03-04T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>https://axiac.ro/blog/debugging-remote-php-cli-scripts-with-phpstorm-and-xdebug</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had to debug a command line PHP script that runs on a remote server and I could not figure out how to do it.
I am using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm">PhpStorm</a> and <a href="http://xdebug.org">XDebug</a>.</p>

<p>PhpStorm comes with a rich set of configurations to run a PHP script, including a couple of presets for debug.
I used them to debug web pages and command line scripts running on the local computer but nothing worked for
scripts running on remote servers.</p>

<p>By reading the documentation of XDebug and PhpStorm I learned that some small tasks must be accomplished
in order to make PhpStorm and XDebug co-operate for debugging.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a name="xdebug-config"></a></p>

<h2>Installing and configuring XDebug</h2>

<p>Installing XDebug depends on the OS that runs on the remote server and everything is explained in the
<a href="http://xdebug.org/docs/">XDebug documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A single line of configuration is required. In <code>php.ini</code> add:</p>

<p><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ini'><span class='line'><span class="na">xdebug.remote_enable</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">1</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<h2>Starting the debugger client</h2>

<p>Due to the way the PHP scripts are invoked by the web server, the communication between the PHP debugger extension
and the debugger client (the IDE) is initiated by the PHP extension. The IDE must be told to start listening for
connections first. PhpStorm has a entry in the <em>Run</em> menu named <em>Start Listen for PHP Debug Connections</em> to
accomplish this task.</p>

<h2>Starting the debugger extension</h2>

<p>Because debugging is not the normal way to run a PHP script, the debugging does not start by only installing
and configuring the XDebug extension. It requires the presence of a special variable in the request or in the
environment.</p>

<p>For CLI scripts this is the environment variable <code>XDEBUG_CONFIG</code>. While its mere presence is enough
to start the debugging, its content is also important: it can be used to override the values declared in <code>php.ini</code>.<br>
More details in the XDebug <a href="http://xdebug.org/docs/remote#starting">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">XDEBUG_CONFIG</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">&amp;</span>lsquo<span class="p">;&amp;</span>rsquo<span class="p">;</span> php script.php
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>By prepending the command line with the initialization of the environment variable, the variable is set only
for that specific execution of the PHP interpreter. To make the variable available on the subsequent commands
it should be set in the shell and <code>export</code>ed for all the applications that will run in the current session:</p>

<p><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">XDEBUG_CONFIG</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">&amp;</span>lsquo<span class="p">;&amp;</span>rsquo<span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>php script.php
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>This is not always the best option but it can help if you are expecting a heavy debug session.</p>

<h2>Configuring path mapping</h2>

<p>Because on the remote host the script is usually located on a different path than on the local machine,
PhpStorm needs a way to know how to map the remote path to the local path. When the debug session starts,
PhpStorm asks the debugger about the value of the environment variable <code>PHP_IDE_CONFIG</code> (if it is set.)</p>

<p>Its value should look like <code>serverName=name</code> where <em>&lsquo;name&rsquo;</em> is the name of the server configured in
<em>Project Settings->PHP->Servers</em>.</p>

<p>The most convenient way to set this variable to the debugged script is to pass it to the interpreter
as an environment variable.</p>

<p><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PHP_IDE_CONFIG</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">&amp;</span>ldquo<span class="p">;</span><span class="nv">serverName</span><span class="o">=</span>devel-host<span class="p">&amp;</span>rdquo<span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">XDEBUG_CONFIG</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">&amp;</span>lsquo<span class="p">;&amp;</span>rsquo<span class="p">;</span> php script.php
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Check <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/webide/2012/03/new-in-4-0-easier-debugging-of-remote-php-command-line-scripts/">this post</a> on PhpStorms&rsquo;s blog for details.</p>

<h2>What else is missing?</h2>

<p>I followed all the steps above by the book, double checked them, but the remote debugger continued to ignore
all my efforts. I searched on the Internet but the directions I could find did not help very much. So, I went
back to the documentation.</p>

<p>XDebug provides an exhaustive <a href="http://xdebug.org/docs/remote">description</a> of how to set up remote PHP debugging. It explains
there how the debug extension communicates with the client program (PhpStorm, in my case) and this was
the starting point on the path to the solution of the problem.</p>

<p>Back to the <a href="#xdebug-config">XDebug configuration</a>, <code>xdebug.remote_connect=1</code> tells it to attempt to connect
to the host defined by <code>xdebug.remote_host</code> on port defined by <code>xdebug.remote_port</code>. The default values for
them are <code>localhost</code> and <code>9000</code>.<br>
Keep in mind that <code>localhost</code> refers to the host where the XDebug runs and that is the remote host and not
the machine where the PhpStorm runs. This is why XDebug cannot communicate with PhpStorm.</p>

<p>Setting <code>xdebug.remote_host</code> to the IP address of the local machine should do the trick, except that I cannot
make it work. The remote server where the PHP scripts run is somewhere in the Internet. The workstation where
PhpStorm runs is connected to a LAN that is behind a firewall. It uses an intranet IP address (<code>192.168.*.*</code>)
and this (and the firewall) prevents the XDebug extension to call back to the IDE in order to start debugging.</p>

<h2>Eventually, the solution</h2>

<p>The solution is simple: create a SSH tunnel from port <code>9000</code> on the remote server to port <code>9000</code> of the local
machine.</p>

<p>In order to start the PHP script on the remote server, I already log into the remote machine using <code>ssh</code>.
All I had to do was to log out then log in again appending <code>-R 9000:localhost:9000</code> to the <code>ssh</code> command line.</p>

<p><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>ssh user@remote-host -R 9000:localhost:9000
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Then I set up the environment variables as above, started the PHP script and the magic happened.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>Recently I had to deal with a PHP script that was designed to run as a cron job. It does a simple
processing: gets some data, creates a CSV file and sends the file using email.</p>

<p>When I manually ran it on the development environment everything went well except for the email not being
sent and this strange line of text sneaked in the script&rsquo;s output:</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">sh: 1: -t: not found</code></pre></div></p>

<p>The email not being sent wasn&rsquo;t a surprise, I knew that for some (technical or business) reason, the PHP code
is unable to send emails from that particular machine. The strange error message (strange for me) is a different story.
It was not generated by my code or by any of its dependencies.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Sure, a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22sh:+1:+-t:+not+found%22" title="Search this message on Google">search on Google</a> could bring some light over the mystery; this is how you reached this page,
isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Eventually I discovered the root cause of the problem by getting PHP info from the command line.</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>php -i <span class="p">|</span> grep sendmail
<span class="nv">sendmail_from</span> <span class="o">=</span>&gt; no <span class="nv">value</span> <span class="o">=</span>&gt; no value
<span class="nv">sendmail_path</span> <span class="o">=</span>&gt; -t -i <span class="o">=</span>&gt; -t -i
Path to <span class="nv">sendmail</span> <span class="o">=</span>&gt; -t -i</code></pre></div></p>

<p>The email is not sent because the property <code>sendmail_from</code> is not set in <code>php.ini</code>.</p>

<h3>The solution</h3>

<p>The fix is really easy: open <code>/etc/php.ini</code>, search for key <code>sendmail_path</code> and make sure it reads:</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">sendmail_path</span><span class="o">=</span>sendmail -t -i</code></pre></div></p>

<p>Additional or different parameters can be added after the command name (<code>sendmail</code>). If you use
a different mail program on your system (<code>qmail</code>, <code>postfix</code> or something else) then replace <code>sendmail</code> with the
name of the mail program you use. This is usually not necessary because most of the alternative mail programs
create a link called <code>sendmail</code> that points to the actual mail program (for compatibility.)</p>

<h3>The mystery</h3>

<p>However, what is the meaning of each component of the error message?</p>

<p>I peeked into the source code of PHP (version 5.4.16) on GitHub and this is what I found. The code that handles
a call to the <code>mail()</code> function is located in file <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-5.4.16/ext/standard/mail.c" title="Open the PHP code file on GitHub">ext/standard/mail.c</a>.
On line <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-5.4.16/ext/standard/mail.c#L324" title="Highlight the code on line 324">324</a> it reads:</p>

<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>mail.c <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-5.4.16/ext/standard/mail.c#L324">https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-5.4.16/ext/standard/mail.c#L324</a> See the complete file on GitHub </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>324</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="n">sendmail</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">popen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sendmail_cmd</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ldquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rdquo</span><span class="p">;);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Several lines above, the variable <code>sendmail_cmd</code> is initialized with the value of <code>sendmail_path</code> defined in <code>php.ini</code> followed
by the value of the 5<sup>th</sup> parameter of function <code>mail()</code>, if provided (its name is <code>$additional_parameters</code>.)<br />
In my case, the first parameter of <code>popen()</code> was <code>-t -i</code> (no extra parameters were provided on the call to <code>mail()</code>.)</p>

<h4>Who is popen() and what does it do for a living?</h4>

<p><code>popen()</code> is a system function from the standard C library. Details can be found by running <code>man popen</code> in an Unix/Linux shell.
See some relevant fragmens below:</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-man" data-lang="man">SYNOPSIS
  FILE *
  popen(const char &lt;em&gt;command, const char &lt;/em&gt;mode);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
  The popen() function &amp;ldquo;opens&amp;rdquo; a process by creating a bidirectional pipe, forking,
  and invoking the shell.
  &amp;hellip;
  The &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; argument is a (&amp;hellip;) string containing a shell command line. This command
  is passed to &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;, using the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; flag; interpretation, if any, is performed
  by the shell.</code></pre></div></p>

<p>This means <code>popen()</code> creates an instance of the classic Bourne shell <code>/bin/sh</code> and tells it to run the command <code>-t -i</code>.
I tried this on the devel machine:</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">axiac:~<span class="nv">$ </span>/bin/sh
<span class="nv">$ </span>-t -i
sh: 1: -t: not found</code></pre></div></p>

<p>Et voilà! The error message is there!</p>

<h4>Further investigation</h4>

<p>I ran this command on several other Linux/Unix systems (including a Mac OS X Lion) and some of them provided the same
output while on the others the <code>1:</code> part was missing. Further investigation revealed that on <em>some</em> of the systems that
produce the error message <em>containing</em> the <code>1:</code> fragment, <code>/bin/sh</code> is, in fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Almquist_shell" title="More info about Debian ash on Wikipedia"><code>dash</code></a>.</p>

<p>I run several other commands on <code>dash</code>&rsquo;s command line and I found out that <code>1</code> from <code>1:</code> is the number of the command
it (attempted to) ran since it started.</p>

<p>I never worked with <code>dash</code> before (except when I thought <code>/bin/sh</code> is a symlink to <code>bash</code> and in fact it was <code>dash</code>.)
I cannot tell why <code>dash</code> numbers the commands it runs and how can it be configured to do (or to not do) it so.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Investigating this cryptic error message we found some interesting things about the implementation of PHP. On a Linux/Unix
system there are at least three ways to launch another program: <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html"><code>fork()</code></a>+<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html"><code>exec()</code></a>,
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html"><code>system()</code></a>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html"><code>popen()</code></a>. By default, <code>sendmail</code>
reads the message to send from <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stdin.3.html"><code>STDIN</code></a>. From the three methods above, <code>popen()</code> is the easiest (and the most natural) way
to launch <code>sendmail</code> and pass some text to it.</p>

<p>More than that, because <code>popen()</code> doesn&rsquo;t run the command by itself but passes it to a shell instance, this approach provides
higher flexibility on defining the command used to send emails from PHP.
The first token of <code>sendmail_path</code> configuration value can be a shell alias, a shell function, a pipe of commands, a list of commands
or even a small script.</p>
